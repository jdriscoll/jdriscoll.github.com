title: I write software for people.
---

My name is Justin Driscoll. I'm the lead software developer at [Makalu Interactive](http://makaluinc.com) where I design and develop [web and mobile software](http://github.com/jdriscoll). In my spare time I wrote an iOS notebook app called [OnePAD](http://www.onepadapp.com) and started a couple of moderately popular open source projects for Django. When I'm not sitting in front of a computer I enjoy playing guitar, cooking and watching television shows a whole season at a time.
