title: OnePAD Website Redesign
excerpt: I redesigned the OnePAD website and upgraded it from static files to the Middleman static site generator.
---

The original [OnePAD website](http://www.onepadapp.com) was thrown together in Coda over a weekend and deployed as a static website on Amazon S3. This setup has worked exceptionally well. At least for a one and even two-page site. I've been wanting to expand the site for a while now though, and when I came across the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator, it seemed like a fun project for a Saturday afternoon.

Middleman is very simliar to (based on?) [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator that powers Github pages and this blog, but it mixes in a very rails-like stack of helpers including support for multiple template languages. Being familiar with both Rails and Jekyll it was pretty easy to hit the ground running with Middleman and within a few hours I had the new site published.

Like everything else on the web, the site is far from "finished". I do think it's an improvement on the original iterations though. Take a look if you like and let me know what you think.
