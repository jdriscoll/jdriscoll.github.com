title: ImageKit Has Moved
---

<p>I&#8217;m very happy to announce that the ImageKit project has acquired a trio of new maintainers. <a href="http://twitter.com/gregnewman" target="_blank">Greg Newman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bryanveloso" target="_blank">Bryan Veloso</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisdrackett" target="_blank">Chris Drackett</a> have generously offered to help keep the project moving forward and bug-free.</p>



<p>In the interest of easier collaboration, the project&#8217;s main repository and project page have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/jdriscoll/django-imagekit" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Please direct any future issue reports or feature requests to this site.</p>
