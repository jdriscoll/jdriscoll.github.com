title: The iPhone, IMAP and Multiple "From:" Addresses
abstract: I currently manage several email addresses through a single Gmail account, and apart from Google&#8217;s creative interpretation of the IMAP protocol, it&#8217;s been grand. I can send and receive messages to or from any of my accounts from a single, virtually spam-free, inbox. I wanted this ability on my iPhone as well but the setup is not as straightforward as it could be. Here&#8217;s what worked.

<p>I currently manage several email addresses through a single Gmail account, and apart from Google&#8217;s creative interpretation of the IMAP protocol, it&#8217;s been grand. I can send and receive messages to or from any of my accounts from a single, virtually spam-free, inbox. I wanted this ability on my iPhone as well but the setup is not as straightforward as it could be. Here&#8217;s what worked:</p>



<p>First, you need to setup a new mail account on your iPhone for Gmail, but not using the iPhone&#8217;s Gmail account type. Seriously, this is key. To be more specific, after you select &#8220;Add Account&#8230;&#8221;, choose &#8220;Other&#8221;. I should also mention that you can&#8217;t do this using Google Sync&#8217;s Exchange support. Now, after you&#8217;ve typed out your email address and password 12 times and filled in the other important bits as described <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77702" target="_blank">here</a>, you should have a functional IMAP email account. Which leads us to the second (not so) tricky part. The way you add multiple addresses to your new account is to input them into the &#8220;Address&#8221; field, under &#8220;IMAP Account Information&#8221;, with each address separated by a comma. Just like Mail.app! Except, you can&#8217;t type a comma in that field. I&#8217;ll wait while you try it&#8230; No? Good. Anyway, the obvious way around this is open any app that supports editable text, type in your address list, copy it, and paste it back into the &#8220;Address&#8221; field. You could also use the Description field. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>



<p>Now you should be able to select any of the email addresses you entered as the &#8220;From:&#8221; address in Mail.</p>
