[OnePAD](http://www.onepadapp.com) version 1.3 was approved yesterday (after only 5 days!) and is now [available for purchase](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onepad-notebook-and-journal/id523440773?mt=8) and update. I rewrote much of the application launch code for this release which should help alleviate a few sync issues as well as a potential crash on first launch. Additionally, the app now hides empty notes prior to todays date by default. I think this makes browsing back through your notes a much better experience and so far the feedback has been very positive. If you prefer the old behavior there's a new preference in the settings app to disable this feature.

The other major change in the release is the [new icon](http://dribbble.com/shots/674892-OnePAD-Icon) and I'm really happy with the way this turned out. With a recent upgrade to Photoshop CS6 (and after struggling with performance issues and general unfamiliarity in Sketch 2) I decided to completely redesign the OnePAD icon. If you've been holding off on the upgrade I have to say that Photoshop CS6 is a huge improvement (coming from CS4 at least) and I especially love the new pixel snapping options. I haven't had a chance to scratch the surface on what's new in the release and I already feel I've gotten my money's worth.

OnePAD is still [$1.99 on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onepad-notebook-and-journal/id523440773?mt=8) and supports any iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch capable of running iOS 5. I think you'll like it. If you do, please tell your friends and leave a rating or review.
