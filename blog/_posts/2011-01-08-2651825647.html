title: SuperDuper and Hazel's App Sweep
---

<p>If Hazel&#8217;s App Sweep function stops working for you, a backup drive (or folder) might be the problem. Hazel automatically ignores Time Machine volumes but other backups, such as a Super Duper clone, can trick Hazel into thinking the App is still installed.</p>



<p>As of writing this, there&#8217;s currently no way to ignore volumes or folders in the Hazel interface but there is a <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=415" target="_blank">hidden preference</a> for it that you can access easily though the Terminal.</p>



<p>Running the following and restarting Hazel solves the issue:</p>



<pre><code>defaults write com.noodlesoft.Hazel IgnoredBackupDirs -array dir1 dir2

</code></pre>



<p>If you want to ignore a backup drive or your path has spaces in it the command you run might look like this:</p>



<pre><code>defaults write com.noodlesoft.Hazel IgnoredBackupDirs -array "/Volumes/SD Clone"

</code></pre>



<p>If for some crazy reason you don&#8217;t own both <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html" target="_blank">Super Duper</a> and <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" target="_blank">Hazel</a> (and you use a Mac) go buy them both right now.</p>
