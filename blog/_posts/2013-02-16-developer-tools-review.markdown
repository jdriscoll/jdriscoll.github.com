These are a few of the tools I've found useful over the last year. I've tried to exclude the obvious and focus on the software and hardware that might not be as easy to discover.

## The Hardware

This last summer I replaced my original unibody MacBook Pro with a [higher-end mid-2012 non-retina model][MBP]. I've since maxed out the RAM and installed a [super-fast][SSDVid] [OWC Mercury Extreme 6G SSD][OWCSSD]. My MacBook pro is primarily a desktop machine and I keep it up off the desk on a [mStand][mStand] and plugged into a pre-Thunderbolt 27" Cinema Display.

For local backups I use a [NewerTech Yoyager Q][VoyagerQ] (an older model they no longer sell) over Firewire for both my rotating [SuperDuper][SuperDuper] clones and my TimeMachine volume. I also pay for the [CrashPlan][CrashPlan] family plan to keep all the Macs in the house backed up automatically.

I work at a [GeekDesk Max][GeekDesk] and sit on a [Herman Miller Mirra][Mirra] chair when I'm not standing. On my desk you'll find a [Logitech K760 Solar Keyboard][K760], an Apple [Magic Mouse][MagicMouse] on a [Razer Kabuto][Kabuto] mouse mat, a [Magic Trackpad][MagicTrackpad] (on the left side of my keyboard), and a [ScanSnap S1300][ScanSnap] scanner.
