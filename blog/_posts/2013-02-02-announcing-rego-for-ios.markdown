I'm excited to be able to announce that [Makalu](http://makaluinc.com)'s second app [Rego](http://www.regoapp.com) is almost here. We've been working really hard on making sure that Rego is the best way to bookmark, organize and find the places you care about and you can sign up [here](http://www.regoapp.com) to get notified when it's available for download. We think you're going to love it as much as we do.
