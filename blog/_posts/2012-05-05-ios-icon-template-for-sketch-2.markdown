title: iOS Icon Template for Sketch 2
excerpt: I put together a quick iOS icon template for Sketch 2. It's not complete but it includes templates and slices for the iPhone and iPad and the large App Store icon.

I couldn't find anything online, so while trying out the newly released [Sketch 2](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) I put together this simple template file for producing and exporting iOS icon files. It's not complete – there's no settings icon for example – but it includes templates and slices for the iPhone and iPad and the large App Store icon.

I make no guarantees about it's accuracy or usefulness in general. Icon pixel sizes and corner radii were provided by John Hick's [handy icon reference chart](http://iconhandbook.co.uk/reference/chart/ios/).
