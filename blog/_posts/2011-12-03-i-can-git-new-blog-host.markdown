I've designed a new layout and moved adevelopingstory.com to [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). The site was previously hosted on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) but I never really had much interest in the social aspects, and I rarely used the different "post types". With the intermittent outages they've been experiencing, it seemed time to move on. I already use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com) every day. I like the simplicity of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). *And everything is portable.*

I also wanted a new design that emphasized readability and simplicity. The previous design was an existing theme I modified, and I was never totally happy with it. With the new layout there's next to no navigation elements, and the content is definitely the focus. It's still a work in progress of course. I'm sure I'll be tweaking it as time goes on. But for now, I'm satisfied.

I haven't had a chance to do any extensive browser testing so if you notice any issues or rendering errors please [let me know](mailto:justin@driscolldev.com).

*I hope you like it.*
